So for the record, the most recommended way to escape single quotes in a single-quoted string argument is to replace it with (I shit you not)
'"'"'
(that is single quote, double quote, single quote, double quote, single quote)
The explanation being that
1) strings next to each other are concatenated by shell
2) single quoted strings cannot contain single quotes
3) but double quoted strings can.
So basically, you're closing the first singly-quoted string, opening a new doubly-quoted string, emitting the single quote, closing the doubly-quoted string and reopening the singly-quoted string
lol
You might also be able to replace it with
'\''
TL;DR Just don't use single quotes in text data when testing.
